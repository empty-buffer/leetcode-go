### More complex example in one line:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    x := 1; y := 2; x, y = y, x; sum := x + y; fmt.Println(x, y, sum) // Output: 2 1 3
}
```

This does:

- Declare `x := 1`
- Declare `y := 2`
- Swap `x` and `y`
- Calculate sum
- Print results

All on one line using explicit semicolons.

### Your original function for reference:

```go
func OptimalWeek(jobs []Job) int {
    if jobs == nil || len(jobs) == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    sort.Slice(jobs, func(i, j int) bool {
        return jobs[i].paymant > jobs[j].paymant
    })

    sch := make([]bool, 7)
    total := 0

    for i := range jobs {
        j := 6
        if jobs[i].time-1 < j {
            j = jobs[i].time - 1
        }
        for ; j >= 0; j-- {
            if !sch[j] {
                sch[j] = true
                total += jobs[i].paymant
                break
            }
        }
    }

    return total
}
```

---

### Refactor example: compress initialization and conditionals using `;`

```go
func OptimalWeek(jobs []Job) int {
    if jobs == nil || len(jobs) == 0 {
        return 0
    }

    sort.Slice(jobs, func(i, j int) bool { return jobs[i].paymant > jobs[j].paymant })

    sch, total := make([]bool, 7), 0

    for i := range jobs {
        for j := 6; j >= 0 && (j > jobs[i].time-1); j-- {} // set j to min(6, jobs[i].time-1) inline by adjusting loop start
        for ; j >= 0; j-- {
            if !sch[j] { sch[j] = true; total += jobs[i].paymant; break }
        }
    }

    return total
}
```

---

### More aggressively compressing statements with `;` on one line

```go
func OptimalWeek(jobs []Job) int {
    if jobs == nil || len(jobs) == 0 { return 0 }
    sort.Slice(jobs, func(i, j int) bool { return jobs[i].paymant > jobs[j].paymant })
    sch, total := make([]bool, 7), 0
    for i := range jobs {
        j := 6; if jobs[i].time-1 < j { j = jobs[i].time - 1 }
        for ; j >= 0; j-- {
            if !sch[j] { sch[j] = true; total += jobs[i].paymant; break }
        }
    }
    return total
}
```

---

### Explanation of semicolon usage here:

- `j := 6; if jobs[i].time-1 < j { j = jobs[i].time - 1 }`  
  — combines variable initialization and if statement in a single line separated by `;`.

- `if !sch[j] { sch[j] = true; total += jobs[i].paymant; break }`  
  — multiple statements in one block on the same line separated by `;`: set `sch[j]`, add to total, `break`.

- The rest like variable declarations can combine with `:=` supporting multiple variable assignment.

---

### Summary

Using `;` lets you cram multiple statements per line, e.g.:

```go
a := 1; b := 2; if a < b { a = b; b = a }
```

But keep in mind: **this hurts readability** in idiomatic Go; best used sparingly or in generated/obfuscated code.

---

If you want, I can generate an even more condensed one-liner tricky version of the entire function as a demonstration!

And why we need this part?
  for j := 6; j >= 0 && (j > jobs[i].time-1); j-- {} 

Great question!

The line:

```go
for j := 6; j >= 0 && (j > jobs[i].time-1); j-- {}
```

is a somewhat unconventional way to **initialize** the variable `j` to the minimum of `6` and `jobs[i].time-1`.

---

### Explanation

The original code uses:

```go
j := 6
if jobs[i].time-1 < j {
    j = jobs[i].time - 1
}
```

to set `j` to the earliest available time slot to schedule a job, but not beyond index 6 (assuming a 7-day week indexed 0 to 6).

The `for` loop:

```go
for j := 6; j >= 0 && (j > jobs[i].time-1); j-- {}
```

is a clever (but somewhat cryptic) way to do the same:

- It starts `j` at 6.
- The loop condition says "keep decrementing `j` as long as `j > jobs[i].time-1`".
- The loop's *body is empty* (`{}`), so the effect is to **decrement `j` until it's less than or equal to `jobs[i].time-1`**.
- After this loop ends, `j` will be `min(6, jobs[i].time-1)`.

---

### Why might someone do this?

- To avoid writing an `if` statement.
- To perform the "minimum" calculation inline using a loop instead of a conditional.

---

### But is it good style?

Generally, **no** — this is unnecessarily complicated and less clear:

- The standard `if` assignment is easier to understand and more efficient.
- Writing an empty loop just to adjust `j` is harder to read and can confuse maintainers.

---

### More idiomatic alternatives

1. Use the if:

```go
j := 6
if jobs[i].time-1 < j {
    j = jobs[i].time - 1
}
```

2. Use the standard `min` pattern (Go has no built-in `min`, so define one):

```go
func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b { return a }
    return b
}

// then:
j := min(6, jobs[i].time-1)
```

---

### Summary

- The empty `for` loop is a clever hack to set `j` to the minimum of two values by decrementing.
- It is equivalent to the simpler `if` assignment.
- It's generally better to avoid this pattern for clarity and simplicity.

---

If you want, I could help refactor your function to be clearer by removing that loop in favor of an `if` or a `min` helper function!
